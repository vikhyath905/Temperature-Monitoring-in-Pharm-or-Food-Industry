# 🧊 Temperature Monitoring System for the Pharmaceutical and Food Industry

This project presents the development of a real-time temperature monitoring system tailored for critical cold-chain environments, such as pharmaceutical storage and food logistics. The goal was to ensure temperature-sensitive products remain within safe thresholds during storage and transit, maintaining quality, safety, and regulatory compliance.

The system was developed as part of a **Bachelor's final year project**, backed by a **2-year internship** with a research-focused industrial team. It was recognized at the **Karnataka State Council for Science and Technology (KSCST)** and accepted for **academic publication**.
